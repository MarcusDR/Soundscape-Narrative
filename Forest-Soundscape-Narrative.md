# Forest-Soundscape-Narrative

This is a soundscape portraying the sounds of a forest. After lightning strikes during a storm, a fire is started. 

All sounds came from freesound.org

Screenshot 1 shows how I repeated the stream and bird song clips at the end of the soundscape to show how the forest health returns and to create a loop.

Screenshot 2 shows how I overlapped some of the audio clips to create nicer transitions between clips as well as placing a sound in the middle of a longer sound. Although not shown in the screen shot, I also used the fading tool for transitions here.

Reflection: The reason I decided to create a soundscape based around nature is because I have loved nature ever since I was a child. I am an environmental science major here at Pitt so I do field work as a student and plan to do much more fieldwork in my career path after school. These sounds are all too familiar to me and really make me feel at peace. But, nature is not just full of peace as there is life and death. Although I luckily have never experienced a forest fire first hand, I thought I would present one in my soundscape to symbolize death and disarray in an ecosystem but also to show how it(death and disarray) is a vital component to every ecosystem to maintain balance. I also chose to bring back the ‘peaceful’ sounds shown at the beginning to symbolize the ‘recovery’ stage of every ecosystem after a disturbance. I believe I made a soundscape that is rather easy to understand without requiring much concentration to get what is happening. Although I am still an Audacity novice, I believe my transitions between audio files are sufficient and are displayed in a way that is pleasant to listen to.
