Screenshot 1 shows how I repeated the stream and bird song clips at the end of the soundscape to show how the forest health returns and to create a loop.

Screenshot 2 shows how I overlapped some of the audio clips to create nicer transitions between clips as well as placing a sound in the middle of a longer sound. Although not shown in the screen shot, I also used the fading tool for transitions here.
